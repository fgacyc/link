### React Query & GraphQL

- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query)
- [GraphQL Playground](https://graphql-playground.development.fgacyc.com/)
_You can use this playground to test your GraphQL queries and mutations._

React Query is used to manage all data fetching and caching.
The GraphQL usage is simplified to use `useGraphQL` hook.

**Simple Example:**
```typescript
  const { query, ready } = useGraphQL();
  const { data, refetch } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["person"],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const data = await query(fetchSinglePerson, {
        name: "fga.tech@gmail.com",
      });
      return data;
    },
    enabled: ready,
  });
```

### Design System

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
We will be using Tailwind CSS for styling.

_PS: If you want to use third-party libraries, please check with the team first. It will mostly be fine, the only thing we need to ensure is the design is consistent and aligned with the designs._

### Contributing

- Recommended to use [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding.
- Install the recommended extensions, there should be a prompt to install them.
  If not, go to extensions tab and search `@recommended` for all the recommended extensions.

There will be 3 long evergreen branches:
- `main` - **PRODUCTION**, protected, only PRs from `preprod` will be merged into `main`.
- `dev` - Branch out from here for development and merge back into `dev`.
- `preprod` - Protected, only PRs from `dev` will be merged into `preprod`, this will be done for each pre-release. This is where we will do testing and QA.

Try to have your branch name as `feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/your-fix-name` and provide meaningful commit messages.

We will be trying to record all the changes in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
